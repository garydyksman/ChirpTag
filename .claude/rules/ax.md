# ax

> **ABSOLUTE**: Every turn starts with `ax_preflight` — mandatory whenever the ax MCP server is available. Team policy lives in `.agents/rules/` and `.agents/skills/` and is delivered via MCP — do not Read policy files on disk when MCP policy tools are available. Do not load `.ax/policy-private/` or `.ax/policy-inactive/`.

## Turn order

```text
1. ax_preflight          [mandatory — prompt + open/changed files; full bodies in inject]
2. ax_explore / ax_context / ax_search   [code graph — NOT policy]
3. ax_guard              [before Write/Delete on project files when CRITICAL rules exist]
```

> **Run preflight exactly once per turn.** If you already called `ax_preflight` this turn, skip it and continue work.

**Inject fallback:** If step 1 returns no `<ax_policy>` inject (empty `rules`), call `ax_skill("startup")` once before other work.

## Directive capture

When the user states a durable rule — `je moet`, `altijd`, `nooit`, `voortaan`, `always`, `never`, `you must`, `@rule` — persist it. `ax_preflight` sets `directiveDetected` and returns a ready `captureProposal` (rule + `questions`). Ask each question, then call `ax_policy_capture(action="save", rule)` after the user confirms. This works even if the project has no policy yet — the first save bootstraps it. Never silently ignore such a directive.

## Capability discovery

ax is actively developed. **Do not rely on cached knowledge of ax features.** `ax_preflight` returns the latest matched rules, skills, and capabilities every call. When preflight returns tools or rules you haven't seen before, use them.

## Tool reference

| When | Call |
|---|---|
| Start of turn (always) | `ax_preflight` |
| Session start / version check | `ax_status` |
| Code architecture, how something works | `ax_explore`, `ax_search`, `ax_node` |
| Impact analysis before changes | `ax_impact`, `ax_callers`, `ax_callees` |
| Which tests are affected by changes | `ax_affected` |
| Architecture overview: communities, god nodes, surprising links | `ax_insights` |
| Full Markdown architecture report | `ax_report` |
| Pre-write policy guard (CRITICAL rules) | `ax_guard` (`path` + `operation`; also `paths[]` / `action`) |
| Correlate editor/linter diagnostics with the graph | `ax_diagnostics` (pass `diagnostics[]` gathered from the IDE) |
| Capture durable rules | `ax_policy_capture` |
| Incremental re-index after edits | `ax_sync` |
| Full index rebuild | `ax_index({ "force": true })` |
| LSP status / Exact-edge enrich | `ax_lsp` (`action`: `status` \| `enrich`) |
| Quality gate / CI evaluate | `ax_ship` (`mode`: `evaluate` \| `ci`) |
| Refresh policy from `.agents/` | `ax_policy_index` |
| Store / search memories | `ax_remember` / `ax_recall` |
| Build task context | `ax_context` |

**Prefer MCP over shell:** When ax MCP is connected, call these tools directly — do **not** run `ax sync` / `ax lsp` / `ax ship --ci` / `ax policy index` / `ax remember` via the terminal. Shell CLI is only for DEGRADED mode or ops with no MCP tool (install, upgrade, web, share, ship --watch).

## Hard rules

- Never skip step 1 on a new user message.
- **Run preflight exactly once per turn** — do not re-call after the startup skill.
- MCP unreachable → report `ax MCP unreachable: [error]`, state `Mode: DEGRADED`, do not proceed silently.
- For structural code questions (how X works, call paths, blast radius) call `ax_explore` **before** broad Grep/Read — not policy tools and not a Grep-first sweep.
- Graph answers are source: `ax_explore` and `ax_node` return numbered source from the index; treat it as already read. `ax_node` returns a symbol's full source plus direct callers and callees, so use it instead of Read. A snippet marked truncated → `ax_node` on that symbol. A reply ending in an `[ax context cache]` footer → `ax_expand` with its id. Where the graph covers the code, do not Read or Grep the file to fill the gap. Read is for files the graph does not index (config, docs, generated output) or a file right before you edit it.
- Conversation cache: A repeated graph call in this conversation returns a short `[ax cache hit]` reference; the answer is already in your context, or `ax_expand` with its id returns it. Read `<ax_session_context>` in preflight before searching again; pass `fresh: true` to force a new query.
- Working context: Record a durable fact, file, symbol, decision, or open question with `ax_session` (actions `add`, `update`, `compact`, `clear`, `fork`, `handoff`). Preflight shows `<ax_working_context>`; pass its hash as `known_context` and an unchanged snapshot comes back as one line. Pass the `session` id from `<ax_chat>` to every ax call in this chat; a preflight without it starts a new chat. A changed index marks it stale; `compact` confirms the notes against the current index. fork copies these notes to a new session. handoff starts a new session from the note you send. The old session stays readable, and the graph cache is not copied. `ax_durable` stores this chat's transcript, documents, and checkpointed tasks.
- If `ax_status` reports a stale index or outdated version, warn immediately and suggest `ax upgrade` or re-index.
