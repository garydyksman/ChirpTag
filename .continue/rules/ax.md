# ax

Call **`ax_preflight`** exactly once per turn **before all other work**. This is mandatory whenever the `user-ax` MCP server is available — regardless of whether `.agents/` exists locally. Team rules and skills arrive via MCP inject — do not Read `.agents/` or `.ax/policy/` files on disk when MCP policy tools are available.

**Git-shared team files:** `.agents/rules/` and `.agents/skills/` (each skill is a directory with `SKILL.md`). Do not load `.ax/policy-private/` or `.ax/policy-inactive/`.

**Inject fallback:** If the response lacks team policy (no `<ax_policy>` in `inject`, or empty `rules`), call **`ax_skill("startup")`** once — then continue.

**Explore before Grep/Read (CRITICAL):** For structural code questions, call **`ax_explore`** (or graph tools) **before** broad `Grep` / `Read`. Skipping this burns tokens and lowers MCP quality (`ExploreBeforeGrep`).

**Graph answers are source:** `ax_explore` and `ax_node` return numbered source from the index; treat it as already read. `ax_node` returns a symbol's full source plus direct callers and callees, so use it instead of Read. A snippet marked truncated → `ax_node` on that symbol. A reply ending in an `[ax context cache]` footer → `ax_expand` with its id. Where the graph covers the code, do not Read or Grep the file to fill the gap. Read is for files the graph does not index (config, docs, generated output) or a file right before you edit it.

**Conversation cache:** A repeated graph call in this conversation returns a short `[ax cache hit]` reference; the answer is already in your context, or `ax_expand` with its id returns it. Read `<ax_session_context>` in preflight before searching again; pass `fresh: true` to force a new query.

**Working context:** Record a durable fact, file, symbol, decision, or open question with `ax_session` (actions `add`, `update`, `compact`, `clear`, `fork`, `handoff`). Preflight shows `<ax_working_context>`; pass its hash as `known_context` and an unchanged snapshot comes back as one line. Pass the `session` id from `<ax_chat>` to every ax call in this chat; a preflight without it starts a new chat. A changed index marks it stale; `compact` confirms the notes against the current index. fork copies these notes to a new session. handoff starts a new session from the note you send. The old session stays readable, and the graph cache is not copied. `ax_durable` stores this chat's transcript, documents, and checkpointed tasks.

**Directive capture:** When the user gives durable rules (`je moet`, `always`, `never`, `@rule`), call **`ax_policy_capture`** with `action: "propose"`, ask each question from `questions[]`, and save only after explicit confirmation (stored in ax.db).

## Capability discovery

ax is actively developed. **Do not rely on cached knowledge of ax features.** `ax_preflight` returns the latest matched rules, skills, and capabilities every call. When preflight returns tools or rules you haven't seen before, use them.

## Tool reference

| When | Call |
|---|---|
| Start of turn (always) | `ax_preflight` |
| Session start / version check | `ax_status` |
| Code architecture, how something works | `ax_explore`, `ax_search`, `ax_node` |
| Impact analysis before changes | `ax_impact`, `ax_callers`, `ax_callees` |
| Which tests are affected by changes | `ax_affected` |
| Architecture overview: communities, god nodes, surprising links | `ax_insights` |
| Full Markdown architecture report | `ax_report` |
| Pre-write policy guard (when CRITICAL rules exist) | `ax_guard` (`path` + `operation`; also `paths[]` / `action`) |
| Capture durable rules | `ax_policy_capture` |
| Incremental re-index after edits | `ax_sync` |
| Full index rebuild | `ax_index({ "force": true })` |
| LSP status / Exact-edge enrich | `ax_lsp` (`action`: `status` \| `enrich`) |
| Quality gate / CI evaluate | `ax_ship` (`mode`: `evaluate` \| `ci`) |
| Refresh policy from `.agents/` | `ax_policy_index` |
| Store / search memories | `ax_remember` / `ax_recall` |
| Full source of a symbol (instead of Read) | `ax_node` |
| Rest of a cut reply | `ax_expand` (id from the footer) |
| Build task context | `ax_context` |

**Prefer MCP over shell:** When ax MCP is connected, call these tools directly — do **not** shell `ax sync` / `ax lsp` / `ax ship --ci` / `ax policy index`. Shell CLI is only for DEGRADED mode or ops with no MCP tool.

## Version freshness

If `ax_status` reports a stale index or outdated version, warn immediately and suggest `ax upgrade` or re-index.

## Degraded mode

MCP unreachable → report `ax MCP unreachable: [error]`, state `Mode: DEGRADED`. Do not silently proceed without policy checks.
